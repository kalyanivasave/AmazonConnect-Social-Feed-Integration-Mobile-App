# 🛍️ AmazonConnect: Amazon Social Feed Integration  
*Enhancing Product Discovery through Social Engagement*

This project reimagines the Amazon mobile experience by introducing **social media features** such as posting, following, commenting, and live auctions—designed to increase user engagement, personalization, and in-app discovery.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design a new **"Social Feed"** tab within the Amazon app that:

- Attracts users familiar with social platforms like Twitter.
- Encourages interaction between customers and sellers.
- Supports product discovery via community content.
- Fosters long-term engagement through social incentives.

## 🧠 Design Process

We followed a **5-step UX strategy**:

1. **Research & Competitive Analysis**  
   Compared Amazon with social platforms like Twitter. Identified gaps in engagement and personalization.

2. **Problem Framing**  
   Defined sprint questions such as:  
   *"How might we make Amazon more social without disrupting its core functionality?"*

3. **Solution Sketching**  
   Created multiple ideas using Crazy 8s, then refined one direction: integrating a dedicated “Feed” tab.

4. **Prototyping**  
   Developed high-fidelity UI screens in Figma showcasing:
   - Feed browsing
   - Post creation
   - Commenting, reposting, following

5. **User Testing & Feedback**  
   Tested with 50+ users. 
   - Key takeaways:
   - Users liked the familiarity and clean layout.
   - Confusion due to multiple navigation paths to the feed.
   - Suggested combining social actions into fewer steps.
