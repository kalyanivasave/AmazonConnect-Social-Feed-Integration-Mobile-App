# 🛍️ Amazon social: Reimagining Product Discovery Inside Amazon  

*Bringing trust, discovery, and community into the world’s largest e-commerce platform.*  

---

## Project Objective  

**Amazon Social** introduces a dedicated **Social Feed** inside the Amazon app.  

This feature addresses the **discovery gap** — where shoppers currently leave Amazon to validate purchases on YouTube, Reddit, or Instagram — by embedding **community-driven product discovery** directly into Amazon’s ecosystem.  

With Amazon Social, shoppers can:  
- Discover products through authentic posts from trusted influencers, and Amazon Vine reviewers.  
- Engage with posts by liking, commenting, and reposting.  
- Access trusted discounts and early-purchase offers.  
- Join niche communities (e.g., *Home Bakers*, *Travel Essentials*) for curated recommendations.  

Amazon remains **commerce-first**, while discovery becomes **seamless and social**.

## Design Process  

This project followed a **sprint-based UX process**:  

1. **Understanding Users**  
   - Studied how shoppers validate purchases externally on YouTube, Reddit, and TikTok.  
   - Identified trust gaps and friction points.  

2. **Competitive Research**  
   - Compared Amazon’s transactional model with TikTok and Twitter.  
   - Found opportunities in engagement, discovery, and personalization.  

3. **Problem Framing**  
   - Defined sprint questions such as:  
     *“How might we embed social discovery without disrupting Amazon’s core checkout flow?”*  

4. **Sketching & Brainstorming**  
   - Conducted **Crazy 8s** and group sketching sessions.  
   - Narrowed down to a dedicated **Social Feed tab** blending commerce with community.  

5. **High-Fidelity Prototyping**  
   - Built clickable **Figma screens** to simulate:  
     - Feed browsing  
     - Post creation & sharing  
     - Liking, commenting, and reposting  
     - Following trusted reviewers/influencers  

6. **User Testing**  
   - Shared prototypes with **50+ participants**.  
   - Key feedback:  
     - Users loved the familiar social feel inside Amazon’s UI.  
     - Navigation duplication caused confusion → simplified in later iterations.  
     - Needed clearer separation between shopping and social actions.
